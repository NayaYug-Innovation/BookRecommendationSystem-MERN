This project is a Book Recommendation System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The backend is powered by Express and uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data handling. It also integrates jsonwebtoken for user authentication and dotenv for environment variable management. CORS is enabled to allow secure cross-origin requests. This is the initial version, and more features and improvements will be added as development progresses.
